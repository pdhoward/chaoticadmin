// NOTE
/*
Most admin apps require authentication. Admin-on-rest can check user credentials before displaying a page,
and redirect to a login form when the REST API returns a 403 error code.

What those credentials are, and how to get them, are questions that you must answer. Admin-on-rest makes
no assumption about your authentication strategy (basic auth, OAuth, custom route, etc), but gives you the
hooks to plug your logic at the right place - by calling an authClient function.

For this tutorial, since there is no public authentication API we can use, letâ€™s use a fake
authentication provider that accepts every login request, and stores the username in localStorage.
Each page change will require that localStorage contains a username item.

The authClient is a simple function, which must return a Promise:

Tip: As the restClient response is asynchronous, you can easily fetch an authentication server in there.

To enable this authentication strategy, pass the client as the authClient prop in the <Admin> compone
